1. create a Player class. In the Player class, you will create attributes for
the Player type objects. For example, you can create playerLocation. You may
want to create movePlayer() methods to make the player move.
In the while loop, you can create a method to navigate the room but you can
create the loop in the Main class. Go to line 145 of Main class.
Then, you can complete the while loop by including information about the current
 room and sentinel value to decide whether you will allow the user input
 continue or not.
 Then, inside of the while loop, you may want to add nested while loop. Then,
 you will add the case whether it has direction n,e,w,s and provide each case,
 how you will move the player. Do this part first, then let me know.

2. I added Player class.
